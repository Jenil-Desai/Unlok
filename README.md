# 🔐 Unlok — Lightweight Ethereum Token Locking

**Unlok** is a lightweight, gas-efficient Ethereum smart contract that allows users to lock their ERC-20 tokens without any time-bound restrictions and withdraw them instantly when desired. Built with Solidity and OpenZeppelin, it's perfect for vesting, secure holding, or custom on-chain token control use cases.
